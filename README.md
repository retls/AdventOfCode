# Advent of Code 2021 exercises
I'm currently working on exercises that will improve my syntax and logical thinking.
Modern languages like JavaSciprt and Python are much more complex than COBOL i'm currently working in, so i'm trying to learn all the available tools that are available within these languages so i will be able to implement them into my solutions more effectively later on.
