# Advent of Code 2021 exercises
I'm currently working on exercises that will improve my syntax and logical thinking.
Modern languages like JavaSciprt and Python are much more complex than COBOL i'm currently working in, so i'm trying to learn all the available tools that are available within these languages so i will be able to implement them into my solutions more effectively later on.
First i started with JavaScript, and now i'm reprogramming the exercises with Python beacuse it seems that there is more of a demand for Python developers in current time. I will continue programming thses exercises with Python but the first few will have solution in both languages. I still have a long way to go but these exercises will help me get a step closer. :man_student:
